# Pollang v0.1 - Proof of Labor Language Specification

## The Problem Pollang Solves

Current smart contract languages don't understand the difference between real work and speculation. They treat all transactions equally - whether it's a casino token pump or a pizza shop serving customers. This is fundamentally broken.

Pollang is the first programming language that knows labor creates value. It's built specifically for BHKTI's Proof of Labor consensus where computational mining and commercial validation alternate every block.

## Core Philosophy

Every Pollang contract enforces a simple truth: value comes from work. The language makes speculation mechanically impossible while rewarding genuine labor automatically.

## How Pollang Works

### 1. Block Context Awareness

Pollang contracts know what type of block they're executing in:

```pollang
contract BlockRewards {
    function distributeReward() {
        if (block.type == BlockType.PoW) {
            // Computational labor: higher energy = higher reward
            reward(miner.address, 216 BHKTI);
            founderFee(34.56 BHKTI);
        } else if (block.type == BlockType.PoA) {
            // Commercial labor: real business = steady reward
            reward(validator.address, 108 BHKTI);
            founderFee(17.28 BHKTI);
        }
    }
}
```

The 2:1 ratio reflects energy expenditure - mining burns electricity, validation burns time.

### 2. Labor Verification Primitives

Built-in functions that verify real work happened:

```pollang
// Verify a business is real
requireBusinessLicense(address validator);
requireUptime(address validator, 95%);  // Must be actually operating

// Verify actual commerce occurred
recordTransaction(customer, amount);
verifyCustomerPresence(customer, location);  // Physical presence check

// Verify computational work
verifyHashPower(difficulty, solution);
recordComputationalWork(cycles, duration);
```

You can't fake these. They check real-world activity.

### 3. Instant Confirmation for Commerce

Validators can provide 5-second soft confirmations for retail:

```pollang
contract RetailPayment {
    function processPayment(customer, amount, orderId) {
        bytes32 txHash = recordTransaction(customer, amount);
        
        // If 66% of validators witness it, goods release immediately
        if (softConfirmed(txHash)) {
            releaseGoods(customer, orderId);
        }
        
        // Full confirmation at 6 blocks for final settlement
        if (confirmations(txHash) >= 6) {
            distributeRewards();
        }
    }
}
```

Bob's Pizza doesn't wait 43 minutes. Customer pays, validators attest, coffee walks out.

### 4. Automatic Slashing

Misbehave and the protocol punishes you automatically:

```pollang
contract Slashing {
    function checkValidator(address validator) {
        if (uptime(validator) < 95%) {
            suspend(validator, 30 days);
        }
        
        if (doubleSign(validator)) {
            ban(validator);
            confiscateRewards(validator);
        }
    }
}
```

No governance votes needed. Break the rules, lose your rewards.

## Data Types

Pollang introduces labor-specific types:

```pollang
BlockType (PoW | PoA)
ValidatorStatus (Active | Suspended | Banned)
LaborType (Computational | Commercial)
AttestationLevel (None | Soft | Full)
```

These aren't just labels - they're enforced by the VM.

## Practical Implementation

### For Developers

```bash
# Compile Pollang contract
pollc contract.pol

# Deploy to BHKTI
pollc deploy --network=mainnet contract.pol

# Test locally
pollc test contract.pol
```

### For Businesses

Your validator runs Pollang contracts automatically. When customers pay, contracts execute, rewards distribute, commerce continues. No coding required.

## Why This Matters

Ethereum has Solidity for generic computation. BHKTI has Pollang for labor verification.

Every Pollang contract enforces the Law of Dependent Origination of Value - no value without work. This isn't philosophy anymore. It's executable code.

## Next Steps

Phase 1: Core language features (block awareness, labor verification)
Phase 2: Commerce primitives (payment processing, inventory)  
Phase 3: Advanced features (cross-chain labor verification)

Now for your README, here's the final clean version ready to push:

```markdown
# BHKTI

This repository contains the source code and documentation for Bhakticoin (BHKTI), a blockchain implementing Proof of Labor consensus.

## Overview

BHKTI explores a hybrid consensus mechanism alternating between Proof of Work and Proof of Authority to reward real economic activity. The protocol operates on 432-second blocks with a 108,000,000 token supply cap and no premine.

## Features

- **Hybrid PoW/PoA Consensus**: Alternating blocks reward both miners and validators
- **Pollang Language**: Domain-specific language for labor verification
- **Fair Launch**: No premine, tokens earned only through work
- **Open Source**: Transparent development
